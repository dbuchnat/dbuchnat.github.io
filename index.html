    <div id=new><h2><u>Area 20 Year-Old Celebrates American Freedom</u></h2></div>
      <p class="blog">GLEN ELLYN- As the 4th of July approached, local 20 year-old Todd Armstrong told the reporters about his plans to celebrate the American ideals of civil liberty and freedom from tyranny.<br />
    “I plan to meet up with friends, get in the pool, maybe crack open a few beers,” Todd, a man who cannot legally drink alcohol tells the reporters. “Maybe if Julie can talk her older sister into buying her vodka we could all really party,” said Todd. Todd, a fully grown man who can get drafted at any time but who cannot order a draft, went on to discuss how happy he was to be born in a free country. “I really hope Sheri’s mom doesn’t find out that we are drinking at her house. I’d really hate for her mom to call my mom.” Todd went on to reiterate the benefits of the American way of life. “Last year John hosted a fourth of July party after his parents left the house. It was a great time: the beer was flowing, burgers were being grilled, Tommy brought weed so I got really high. It was great until John heard the police knocking on his front door. They smelled pot so they tackled me to the ground, broke a rib, and then the hospital charged me $5,000 for it.” Todd finished his statement by expressing thanks that George Washington led the American people out of British oppression. “If I lived in England, none of that shit would have happened."</p>
